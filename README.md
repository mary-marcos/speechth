A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Key Features:

- Educational Resources: In addition to therapy exercises, SpeechTh provides access to educational resources and materials for parents and caregivers. These resources offer valuable information and tips for supporting children with speech difficulties at home.
- User-Friendly Interface: With a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, SpeechTh is easy for children to use independently or with guidance from parents and therapists. The app's design prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity for users of all abilities.
